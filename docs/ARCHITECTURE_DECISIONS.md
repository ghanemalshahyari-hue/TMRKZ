# MOVER — Architecture decision record

Each decision lists the context, the choice, and — where it differs from `handoff/ARCHITECTURE.md` — why.
Status values: **Accepted** (in force), **Provisional** (in force until the named open decision is made).

## ADR-001 Stack and version pinning — Accepted

- Backend: Java 21 (Temurin 21.0.12.1), Spring Boot **4.0.9**, Flowable **8.0.0**, PostgreSQL **17.11**, Flyway 11.14.
- Compatibility evidence: `flowable-dependencies-8.0.0.pom` (Maven Central) declares `spring.boot.version 4.0.2`,
  `spring.framework.version 7.0.3`, `jdk.version 17`. We stay on the same Spring Boot 4.0.x line and take the latest
  patch release (4.0.9) for security fixes; patch releases are API-compatible by Spring's policy. The whole
  acceptance suite runs against this exact combination. Flowable 7.2.0 (Spring Boot 3.5) was the alternative; it was
  not chosen because the 3.x line is at the end of its open-source support window.
- Frontend: React 19.3.1, Vite 7.3.7, TypeScript 5.9.3, Leaflet 1.9.4 (same version as the prototype).
- Images pinned by exact tag: `postgres:17.11-alpine`, `maven:3.9.16-eclipse-temurin-21` (build only),
  `eclipse-temurin:21.0.12.1_1-jre-alpine`, `node:24.18.1-alpine` (build only), `nginx:1.28.3-alpine`.
  `ops/airgap-bundle.sh` records the resolved image IDs in the offline bundle.

## ADR-002 Modular monolith with JDBC (no JPA) — Accepted

Modules are Java packages with service façades: `security` (identity adapter), `access` (authorisation), `org`,
`facilities`, `forms`, `workflow`, `requests`, `reservations`, `attachments`, `audit`, `outbox`, `reports`, `policy`,
`integrations`, `system`. Data access is plain SQL through Spring `JdbcClient` because the core invariants rely on
PostgreSQL features (range types, exclusion constraints, recursive CTEs, row locks) that should stay visible in the
code. Flyway owns the business schema; Flowable creates its own `ACT_*` tables in the same database.

## ADR-003 Local identity with server-side sessions — Provisional (D-04)

Proposed: Keycloak. Chosen: the `security` module is a local identity adapter (BCrypt passwords, account lock-out,
opaque session token in an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookie, only its SHA-256 stored server-side, idle and absolute
expiry). Reason: the organisation's identity system and its contract are undecided (D-04); a local adapter keeps the
air-gapped deployment self-contained and lets revocation take effect immediately (no long-lived JWT). Replacing it
with OIDC/LDAP (e.g. Keycloak) changes only `AuthService`/`SessionFilter`; the rest of the system consumes `Actor`.

## ADR-004 In-process relationship authorisation instead of OpenFGA — Accepted

Proposed: OpenFGA. Chosen: `AccessService` evaluates, on every HTTP request and inside the same database, the
caller's active memberships and delegations (dated, role-based, organisation and/or site scope, summary-only flag).
Reasons: (1) the source of truth for memberships is the business database, so there is no synchronisation lag
between a membership ending and access being withdrawn — the architecture note itself warns that a reliable sync
path is required and that doubt must deny; (2) lists, searches, counters, exports and reports use one SQL predicate
built from the same grants (`AccessService.requestPredicate`), which a separate tuple store cannot provide without
duplicating data; (3) one fewer stateful service to back up and restore. The module boundary (`AccessContext`)
allows moving to OpenFGA later if relationship complexity grows.

Rules implemented: creator sees own requests; VIEW grants cover a request through its owner, participant
organisations and the organisations administering the requested facilities, or through site scope; info recipients
see a summary after approval; reviewers must hold the task's role with REVIEW (APPROVE for the final stage) and a
scope reaching the task's target organisation; a requester can never decide on their own request.

## ADR-005 Workflow studio compiles a typed definition to BPMN; Flowable embedded — Accepted

The studio edits a typed JSON definition (stages, ALL/ANY completion, reviewer slots by role and organisation source,
typed conditions, SLA, final signed stage, execution templates). Publishing validates it, compiles it to BPMN 2.0
(`BpmnCompiler`: exclusive gateway → parallel multi-instance user task → merge per stage) and deploys it to the
embedded Flowable engine. The only expressions in generated BPMN call the fixed `moverWf` bean with stage-key
literals; administrators never write expressions, scripts or SQL (AT-33). Requests start the exact process
definition id pinned at submission, so new versions never affect running instances (AT-14). `bpmn-js` was not
adopted: a free-form BPMN editor would allow constructs and expressions the rule language forbids; the generated
BPMN is downloadable for review.

Flowable shares the application's `DataSource` and transaction manager: completing the final task, inserting the
reservation locks, the decision, the approval document, the audit row and the outbox event commit or roll back
together (proved by AT-10, AT-11, AT-27).

## ADR-006 Reservations: scope locks under exclusion constraints — Accepted (D-08 default)

A reservation inserts **X** locks on its resource and all descendants and **I** (intent) locks on all ancestors, each
over `[start, end + handover)`. Two exclusion constraints forbid X/X and X/I overlaps on the same resource; I/I is
allowed. Booking two sibling halls works; booking the parent hall over either is refused (AT-36). Periods are
half-open; equal end/start do not overlap unless a handover buffer is configured (AT-12). Open-ended (permanent)
reservations use an unbounded range, never an artificial far date. Shared-policy resources take no exclusive locks;
capacity rules for shared resources are an open item (see STATUS).

## ADR-007 Approval signing modes kept separate — Provisional (D-02)

`INTERNAL_ATTESTATION` (default): the approver re-enters their password; the server computes the SHA-256 of a
canonical approval document bound to the revision hash and stores an HMAC evidence over (mode, person, capacity,
document hash, time) using `MOVER_ATTESTATION_KEY`. The UI and API label it «توثيق داخلي — ليس توقيعاً رقمياً بشهادة».
`PKI`: provider interface with no provider connected; it fails closed with `503 SIGNATURE_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` and
records nothing (AT-27).

## ADR-008 Plain PostgreSQL instead of PostGIS — Provisional (D-01, D-07)

Sites carry a point location and append-only `site_geometry_version` GeoJSON with an explicit CRS label. The map
needs only bounding-box filtering of a few thousand points, which plain columns handle. PostGIS (and a decision on
the organisation's coordinate reference, D-01) should be introduced when real boundary geometries are imported.

## ADR-009 Local map packages — Accepted

`map-packages/<name>/manifest.json` declares source, licence, attribution, coverage, CRS, version and per-file
SHA-256. On start-up the backend registers packages whose checksums verify; the UI draws only installed packages and
reports areas outside their coverage (AT-31). No tile server or CDN is contacted at run time.

## ADR-010 Transactional outbox and in-app notifications — Accepted

Business transactions write `outbox_event` rows; a worker (`OutboxProcessor`, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) turns them
into notifications in its own transaction with unique keys, so redelivery never duplicates effects (AT-28). Failures
back off exponentially and park as FAILED after 10 attempts. External correspondence is not connected (D-04).

## ADR-011 Jackson 2 for stored documents, Jackson 3 for HTTP — Accepted

Spring Boot 4 serialises HTTP with Jackson 3; Flowable 8 and our stored-document handling use Jackson 2.
`JacksonConfig` registers a Jackson 3 serializer that writes Jackson 2 trees as raw JSON (regression-tested).

## ADR-012 Short polling instead of SSE — Accepted

The UI refreshes counters and notifications by polling scoped endpoints. Each poll is a normal authorised request,
so withdrawn access stops updates immediately without channel re-evaluation logic.
